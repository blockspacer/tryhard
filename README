Building

First, you'll need to set up the environment variable STEAM_ROOT to tell VS where your Steam installation lives. This
is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam in Vista or 7.

To add the variable:
1. Start, Right-click on Computer, choose Properties
2. Choose Advanced System Settings
3. Select the Advanced tab, choose Environment Variables...
4. Under "User variables for (you)", choose New...
5. Enter STEAM_ROOT as the variable name, and the path to your Steam installation as the value, without a trailing \
6. Choose OK


In Visual C++:

Open the VS solution file /src/alien_swarm.sln

On the command line:

First, you may need to import VS environment variables:
> call "path/to/vs/install/folder/vc/vcvarsall.bat" x86

Then, in the /src directory:
> msbuild alien_swarm.sln
