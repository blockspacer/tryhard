Requirements
=========================

Steam (http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi)
Alien Swarm SDK (steam://install/513)
MS Visual C++ 2010 (https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express-iso)
  (Express or higher versions)

Getting it working
=========================

Set STEAM_ROOT
-------------------------

First, you'll need to set up the environment variable STEAM_ROOT to tell VS where your Steam installation lives.
This is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam in Vista or 7.

To add the variable:
1. Start, Right-click on Computer, choose Properties
2. Choose Advanced System Settings
3. Select the Advanced tab, choose Environment Variables...
4. Under "User variables for (you)", choose New...
5. Enter STEAM_ROOT as the variable name, and the path to your Steam installation as the value, without a trailing \
6. Choose OK
7. Restart VS if it was running, so it will pick up the added environment variable


Building
-------------------------

Open the VS solution file /src/tryhard.sln. Make sure that client is set as the default project (it should be bolded).
You should be able to hit F5 (or go to Debug -> Start Debugging). The files should be built automatically.

If you want to build the project outside of VS, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. You may need to define VS's environment variables:
> call "path/to/vs/install/folder/vc/vcvarsall.bat" x86
2. cd to the /src directory in your github repo
3. run msbuild:
> msbuild tryhard.sln
